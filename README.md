# Net`Hops`

A community app that lets you establish a network Hop, giving friends and community members secure, domain-specific access, ensuring a tailored browsing experience for each user.

##  Prerequisites

Docker must be installed and running on your system. [Install](https://github.com/docker/docker-install)

##  Server

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filouz/nethops

./configure && make
```

### Managing Profiles
- **Add a Profile**
    ```bash
    NAME="user"
    PASSWORD="strong_password"
    make addProfile name="$NAME" pwd="$PASSWORD"
    ```

- **Revoke a Profile**
    ```bash
    make revokeProfile name="$NAME"
    ```

- **Generate .ovpn Files**
    ```bash
    make ovpnProfile name="$NAME"
    ```

### How to run
```bash
make run
```

For alternative run methods, see `docker/server/docker-compose.yaml`. You can also automate the deployment process using this [ansible collection](https://github.com/filouz/ansible-nethops)

##  Client

### Prerequisites: 

Create a folder `./vault/ovpn` to store your credentials files.

- `client.ovpn`
- `client.pwd` (Optional: Contains the password in plaintext for silent mode.)

You can connect to a Nethops server using [Openvpn Connect](https://openvpn.net/client/).



#### Using Docker


```bash
make client
```

#### Using **docker-compose**

- Use the `docker-compose.yaml` file found at `./docker/client/docker-compose.yaml`.

```bash
cd ./docker/client
docker compose up
```

#### Using **Kubernetes - as sidecar**

Use the `nh_client.yaml` file located at `./deployment/nh_client.yaml`.

## üåê Managing Domains

Modify the `./scripts/domains.conf` file to control which domains users can access via the VPN.

- **Example Structure**:
    ```
    .google.com
    .facebook.com
    .tiktok.com    
    .ipify.org
    ```

- **Domain Specifications**: Domains prefixed with a `.` allow all subdomains. For example, `.google.com` allows access to subdomains like `mail.google.com`.

- **Applying Changes**: After updating the `domains.conf` file, restart the server for the changes to apply.

##  VPN Client API
When the VPN client is running, an API on port ***8080*** is available for VPN connection management:

- **Endpoints**:
    - `/start`: Start the VPN connection.
    - `/stop`: Stop the active VPN connection.
    - `/healthz`: Check service status (returns the current state of the service).
